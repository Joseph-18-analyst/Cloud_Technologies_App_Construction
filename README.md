Wine Analytics Dashboard
The project is a wine analytics dashboard that allows the users to see different varieties of wines prevalent across 7 different countries based on features like province, variety, price and the points. The wine dataset was particularly taken into consideration for the simple fact that it can give a theoretical analysis as to which wine is better of the lot across 7 major wine producing countries of the world. The application made use of a dataset publicly available from Kaggle and it also included several features such as variety, price, location, points, etc. which played a key role in the choice of wine by different individuals across this country. Hence, it laid a strong foundation in the meaningful analysis.

We developed a web application where users can see the appropriate analysis, we have done by the means of knowing wine varieties across these 7 countries. Also, the web app informs the user about the wines that are famous in that country. Further appropriate visualizations are shown based on the wine variety, price, location, ratings, etc. using visualisations such as geographical maps.

Technologies used
The main technologies that were used are as follows:

Task	Technology
Data Cleaning	Apache Spark/Scala
Data Loading/Querying	Apache Spark/Scala
Visualising	Tableau
Frontend	HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, jQuery
Backend	Python Flask, Tableau-Js-API
Deployment	Docker, Kubernetes
Motivation behind Technologies Used:
Data Cleaning
Apache Spark(Scala)
It is 100 times faster than hadoop
Apache Spark carries easy-to-use APIs for operating on large datasets
Apache Spark supports many languages for code writing such as Python, Java, Scala, etc.
Python
We wanted to Tokenize the data
It has multiple methods for data filtering.
Cloud Storage
Bucket
There is a single namespace shared by all buckets
Buckets contain objects which can be accessed by their own methods.
Data Querying
Google BigQuery
Its Flexible Architecture Speeds Up Queries
Access the Data You Need on Demand
Data Visualizations
Tableau
Remarkable Visualization Capabilities
Ease of Use & Implementation
Handles large amounts of data.
Front End
HTML
It is Supported by all Browsers.
It can Integrate Easily with Other Languages.
It is Lightweight.
CSS & Bootstrap
Responsible for web app designing
JavaScript
Extended functionality to web pages.
No compilation needed.
Platform independent.
Backend
Flask
Integrated support for unit testing
Built-in development server and fast debugger
Restful request dispatching.
Containers
Docker
Because of its size and minimal requirements rapid application deployment can be done.
Portability across machines can be done using a single container.
It helps in sharing containers using a remote repository
Application Deployment
Kubernetes
Kubernetes is declarative as it describes the state of cluster.
Kubernetes can run on virtually any public cloud, on-premise hardware, or even bare metal.
Kubernetes determines which Worker Nodes a container should run on based on available resources which optimizes resource usage.
