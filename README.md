Wine Analytics Dashboard


The project is a wine analytics dashboard that allows the users to see different varieties of wines prevalent across 7 different countries based on features like province, variety, price and the points. The wine dataset was particularly taken into consideration for the simple fact that it can give a theoretical analysis as to which wine is better of the lot across 7 major wine producing countries of the world. The application made use of a dataset publicly available from Kaggle and it also included several features such as variety, price, location, points, etc. which played a key role in the choice of wine by different individuals across this country. Hence, it laid a strong foundation in the meaningful analysis.

We developed a web application where users can see the appropriate analysis, we have done by the means of knowing wine varieties across these 7 countries. Also, the web app informs the user about the wines that are famous in that country. Further appropriate visualizations are shown based on the wine variety, price, location, ratings, etc. using visualisations such as geographical maps.
